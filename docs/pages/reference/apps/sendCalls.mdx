# `wallet_sendCalls` Usage

If you want to sponsor your users' transactions, you can do so by passing a paymaster service URL along with EIP-5792 `wallet_sendCalls` requests. Specifically, you will need to include a `paymasterService` object in `capabilities`. This object should have a `url` field that points to your paymaster service, and, optionally, a context object with fields specified by your paymaster service provider.

Smart wallets that support EIP-5792 and ERC-7677 will then communicate with the provided URL according to ERC-7677 to attempt to obtain paymaster values during user operation construction.

## Example

```ts twoslash
const process = { env: { PAYMASTER_URL: '' } }
const provider = { request: (_: any) => {} }
// ---cut---
provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_sendCalls',
  params: [{
    version: '1.0',
    chainId: '0x01',
    from: '0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567',
    calls: [

      },
