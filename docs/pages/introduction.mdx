# Introduction

## What is ERC-7677?

ERC-7677 proposes an EIP-5792-compliant capability for paymaster web service communication by proposing a standardized communication protocol for wallets and ERC-4337 paymaster web services.

This ultimately unlocks the ability for app developers to sponsor their users' transactions.

If you are a wallet, app, or paymaster service developer, see the [Getting Started](./getting-started) section to learn about the changes you'll need to make.
