# Getting Started

There are three parties involved in the ERC-7677 flow: paymaster services, apps, and wallets.

* Paymaster services implement ERC-7677 `pm_` RPC methods.
* Apps give wallets their paymaster service URLs. This is done using the `paymasterService` capability as part of a EIP-5792 `wallet_sendCalls` request.
* Wallets communicate with paymaster services at the URL provided by apps, using the standardized RPC methods to get paymaster-related fields during user operation construction.

Here is a high-level flow of what this looks like:

## Paymaster Services

For a paymaster service to be ERC-7677 compliant, it must implement support for the two `pm_` RPC methods specified in the ERC.

* ### `pm_getPaymasterStubData`
  * Returns stub values to be used in paymaster-related fields of an unsigned user operation for gas estimation.

* ### `pm_getPaymasterData`
  * Returns values to be used in paymaster-related fields of a signed user operation.

See the [reference section](./reference/paymasters/getPaymasterStubData) for details on how these should be implemented.

## Apps

To start using ERC-7677 to sponsor your users' transactions, you'll need to do two things:
1. Sign up with an ERC-7677-compliant paymaster service provider and get a paymaster service URL.
2. Send transactions using the EIP-5792 `wallet_sendCalls` method with the `paymasterService` capability.

One note on paymaster service URLs: service providers typically give developers URLs that have API keys in them. More often than not, you'll want to keep these API keys secret.

As a result, we recommend setting up an endpoint on your app's backend that is ultimately responsible for communication with your chosen paymaster service provider. Check out the [guide on setitng up a paymaster service proxy](/guides/setting-up-paymaster-proxy) for more.

Once you've signed up with a paymaster service provider and set up your proxy, you're ready to use the `wallet_sendCalls` RPC method to start sponsoring your users' transactions. The easiest way to do this is to use Wagmi:

```tsx twoslash [App.tsx]
import React from 'react'
// ---cut---
import { useWriteContracts } from 'wagmi/experimental'
import { parseAbi } from 'viem'

const abi = parseAbi([
  'function approve(address, uint256) returns (bool)',
  'function transferFrom(address, address, uint256) returns (bool)',
])

function App() {
  const { writeContracts } = useWriteContracts()

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        writeContracts({
          contracts: [
            {
              address: '0xFBA3912Ca04dd458c843e2EE08967fC04f3579c2',
              abi,
              functionName: 'approve',
              args: [
                '0xa5cc3c03994DB5b0d9A5eEdD10CabaB0813678AC', 
                100n
              ],
            },
            {
              address: '0xFBA3912Ca04dd458c843e2EE08967fC04f3579c2',
              abi,
              functionName: 'transferFrom',
              args: [
                '0xa5cc3c03994DB5b0d9A5eEdD10CabaB0813678AC',
                '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
                100n
              ],
            },
          ],
          capabilities: { // [!code hl]
            paymasterService: { // [!code hl]
              url: 'https://...' // Your ERC-7677-compliant paymaster service URL. // [!code hl]
            } // [!code hl]
          } // [!code hl]
        })
      }
    >
      Send calls
    </button>
  )
}
```

See the [Wagmi documentation](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContracts) for more.

## Wallets

As a prerequisite, wallets will need to be EIP-5792-compliant to leverage ERC-7677. You can find more about adding EIP-5792 support to your wallet [on this page](https://eip5792.xyz/getting-started).

Once your wallet is EIP-5792-compliant, it will need to do two things to support ERC-7677:
1. Indicate it can support sponsoring transactions via paymaster services as part of its reponse to `wallet_getCapabilities` requests.
```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_getCapabilities',
  params: ['0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567']
})
// @log: {
// @log:   "0x2105": {
// @log:     paymasterService: {
// @log:       supported: true,
// @log:     }
// @log:   }
// @log: }
```
2. Communicate with paymaster services at URLs provided by apps using the new `pm_` RPC methods.
